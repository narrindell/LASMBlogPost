Blog Post on a Semester Project


My QnA Markup project allows individuals to learn about and see if they are eligible for a Trademark application. This software will guide the user through introductory questions and a deeper analysis of whether a Trademark application fits their business needs. 

The ease of the QnA software application made it easy to construct. This flowed over to the ease of actually navigating through the question and answer portion as well for end-users. I was also able to easily host the QnA on a website through Github. 

I had difficulty (and was unsuccessful) at changing the font and colors of the initial “introductory” description of the software. 

I would advise other students to learn how to run Github and QnA markup. I would definitely advise students that are interested in IP litigation, venture start ups and solo practitioners to take advantage of this software in order to build their firms portfolio. 

This semester, I not only learned how to use technology in order to merge with every day legal issues, but I also was able to see how these programs allow individuals to make legal based decisions, work more efficiently when dealing with everyday matters, and how to expand their knowledge and skills to make the legal field more innovative and tech savvy.
